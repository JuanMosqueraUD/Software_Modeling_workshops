# Workshop 3

This repository contains the solution for the new bussines rules made for the workshop number 3 made for the software modeling subject

## New requirements

1. Application is still consuming a lot of memory, so you must reduce it as much as
possible.

2. An authentication system is needed, so you must create a simple login system where
you could register users and authenticate them.

3. You should differentiate two types of users: Admin and User. Admins could create,
update, and delete vehicles, while Users could only see and search the vehicles.

4. You should log all the actions made by the users, so you could track both the changes
made in the vehicles and searches performed.

5. Separate your project in different subsystems, and a made a simple interface to interact
with them.

6. In addition, you must create a monitoring system to check the memory consumption
and time execution of the searches in the application, and save stats in a performance_log file.

7. To increase performance, you should implement a cache system to store the last five, search results over vehicles.

8. Verify if you could add encapsulation to increase the security of the application
